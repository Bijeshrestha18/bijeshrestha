                        <img src="images/image_3.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>

                    <p>Once upon a time in the snug little town where I was the hometown hero, living a life of
                        middle-class glory, I was the apple of everyone's eye. My family's name carried more weight than
                        my school backpack, and even the pigeons on the street would nod in recognition. But, as they
                        say, with great recognition comes great responsibility, or in my case, a perpetual fear of
                        accidentally embarrassing the family.</p>

                    <p> Now, let's delve into the golden days of my childhood when embarrassment took the back seat, a
                        time when kids knew the difference between a tree and a Wi-Fi signal. It was a May morning, and
                        I kicked off my adventure with a glass of what I liked to call "white elixir" (a.k.a. glucose).
                        Fueled by liquid courage, I gathered my gang of misfit comrades – five friends ready for a
                        heroic quest.</p>

                    <p> We raced across fields like a herd of caffeinated gazelles, our pants rolled up as if expecting
                        a flood of epic proportions. We even dared to traverse a minuscule lake, employing a
                        pants-rolled-up strategy that would've made any fashion guru proud. And then, like explorers
                        stumbling upon a hidden treasure, we discovered the mystical jungle of roots – a place that
                        could've doubled as a horror movie set.</p>

                    <p> Our mission? Mangoes. But these weren't your average, reachable-by-standing-on-your-tiptoes
                        mangoes. No, these were perched so high that even our ambitions needed binoculars. Armed with
                        the determination of five young minds, we brainstormed. Climbing? Too dangerous. Sticks? If only
                        they magically grew on trees. Our ingenious plan? Throwing stones and praying for a mango
                        miracle.</p>

                    <p> Spoiler alert: miracles were on vacation that day. Instead, disappointment rained down upon us
                        like confetti at a pity party. We slinked back home, faces wearing expressions that screamed,
                        "We just lost the Fruit Olympics." Ah, the bittersweet taste of failure and the downright bitter
                        taste of no mangoes. Childhood, where even defeat tasted like a misadventure worth cherishing.
                    </p>


                    <p> Krishna, our buddy, burst out, "Guys, guess what? I'm bringing a catapult tomorrow!"</p>


                    <p> Excitement buzzed around us as we got ready to plan our super cool day.</p>


                    <p> "Sujan, can you grab some salt and pepper? We're gonna make the yummiest snacks ever!" I said,
                        thinking about all the deliciousness.</p>


                    <p> "Akash, you're in charge of the knife, okay? We might need it for something awesome!" I grinned,
                        imagining the cool stuff we'd do.</p>


                    <p> Jenith, our stone expert, got his moment, "Jenith, find the best stones for our catapult
                        adventure! It's gonna be epic!"</p>


                    <p> Then, with a big smile, I added, "And me? I'll handle the water, so no one gets thirsty. Ready
                        for the best day ever, friends?"</p>

                    <p> With our simple plans and big giggles, tomorrow's adventure was set to be a day full of fun,
                        friends, and maybe a little mischief!</p>

                    <p> So, there we were, back at home, dreaming of those elusive green mangoes. Not because they were
                        the LeBron James of fruits, but just because, you know, bragging rights. We wanted to be the
                        cool kids who could casually drop, "Oh yeah, we feasted on the forbidden mangoes from that
                        tree."

                    <p> The next day, the gang assembled, and lo and behold, Krishna had brought a catapult. Excitement
                        levels skyrocketed, and off we went on our epic field trip, conquering fields and lakes like
                        mini-adventurers on a quest for the mythical mango treasure.</p>

                    <p> Krishna, armed with his catapult, turned into a mango-sniping maestro. He missed a few shots, of
                        course—precision aiming wasn't his superpower. But with every miss, he inched closer to the
                        jackpot. After what felt like an eternity (but was probably just 15 tries), he finally hit the
                        bullseye, or in our case, the mango hanging high up.</p>

                    <p> Cue our victory dance! We four, like mango-hungry ninjas, sprinted to gather the fallen
                        treasures. The satisfaction on our faces could rival someone who just found the last slice of
                        pizza in the fridge. The transformation from the disappointed bunch from yesterday to the
                        triumphant mango raiders today was nothing short of a cinematic plot twist.</p>

                    <p> And there you have it, folks – a tale of catapults, mango mayhem, and life lessons disguised as
                        fruit escapades, served with a side of giggles and a sprinkle of childhood mischief. In the wild
                        saga of the Great Mango Caper, beneath the layers of catapult chaos and green mango glory, lie
                        some invaluable life lessons that hit us harder than a catapult shot to the fruit jackpot.
                        Krishna's repeated catapult misses taught us that success isn't always instant, especially when
                        flinging stones at mangoes. After a few misfires, he finally nailed it, proving that persistence
                        and a never-give-up attitude are key – whether you're aiming for mangoes or life goals.</p>

                    <p> As we scattered to collect the fallen mango loot, we realized the power of teamwork. Just like
                        ants working together to lift a crumb, we gathered those mangoes like a well-coordinated
                        fruit-fetching squad. Turns out, teamwork isn't just for school projects; it's handy in mango
                        missions too.</p>

                    <p> Sure, those raw mangoes might not have been the pinnacle of taste, but the victory in claiming
                        them was sweeter than a candy shop. Sometimes, it's not about the end result; it's about the
                        journey, the laughs, and the slightly tangy, green rewards you find along the way.</p>

                    <p> Our faces, yesterday versus today, could be a meme template for turning disappointment into
                        delight. Life throws curveballs, but with the right attitude and a touch of humor, you can
                        transform frowns into victory grins faster than you can say "mango madness."</p>

                    <p> The whole adventure, from planning to catapult action, was essentially an epic field trip.
                        Life's not just about textbooks and chores; it's about embracing the unexpected, going on
                        adventures, and making memories. Who knew that a catapult and a mango tree could teach us that?
                    </p>


                    <p> In the end, the Great Mango Caper gifted us more than just a snack; it handed us a basket full
                        of life's little lessons, wrapped in catapult strings and mango peels, and seasoned with the
                        spice of childhood hilarity.</p>
